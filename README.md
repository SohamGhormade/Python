# Python
This repository contains all my projects written in Python.

## C# vs Python
# Python
  + less keystrokes to write same code
  + proves that I can write in language other than C#
  + can compare solution runtime with other python users on leetcode.There are more python coders than C# coders.
  + API is easy to remember and consistent e.g C# has interfaces to be remembered
  - learning curve but I will get better with practice
